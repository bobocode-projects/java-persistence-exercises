Improve your database design and SQL skills
### Task
`AccountDbInitializer` provides an API that allows to create(initialize) a database (one table). It contains a *javadoc* 
that specifies database requirements. `AccountDbInitializer` has a field `DataSource`. Your job is to use that 
`dataSource` and **implement the todo section**. E.g. implement the method `init()` that should **create an account db.** 

The purpose of the task is to **design a database table following docs and naming convention and implement it using SQL and
JDBC API.**

To verify your implementation, run `AccountDbInitializerTest.java`

### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with database design and naming convention, *JDBC API* and *SQL*

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
