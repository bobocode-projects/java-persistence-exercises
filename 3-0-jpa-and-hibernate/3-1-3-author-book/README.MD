Improve your *JPA Many-To-Many* relationship mapping skills
### Task
The relationship between `Author` and `Book` is many to many. In the database this relation is represented as two tables
that are linked with a special **link table**. Your job is to **provide mapping for both entities following notes 
in the todo section.**   

To verify your implementation, run `AuthorBookMappingTest.java`

 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with *JPA* mapping strategies and *Hibernate ORM*

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
