Improve your database design and SQL skills
### Task
`UserProfilesDbInitializer` provides an API that allows to create(initialize) a database tables to store user information,
their work profiles and its relations. Each user can have one and only one profile. A profile is optional and is related 
 to a single user. The job of initializer is to crate proper database tables.
 
`UserProfilesDbInitializer` contains a *javadoc* that specifies database requirements. **It already contains all required Java 
implementation.** Your job is to  **implement SQL file** `table_initialization.sql`.

The purpose of the task is to **design a database table following docs and naming convention and implement it using SQL**
It helps you to **learn the 1 to 1 relations**, and how to design it it the database in **the most efficient way.**

To verify your implementation, run `UserProfilesDbInitializerTest.java`

### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with database design and naming convention, *JDBC API* and *SQL*

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
