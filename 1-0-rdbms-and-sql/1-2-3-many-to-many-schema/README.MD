Improve your database design and SQL skills
### Task
`WallStreetDbInitializer` provides an API that allows to create(initialize) a database tables to store broker information,
sales groups and its relations. Roughly speaking  each group consists of multiple brokers, and each broker can be 
associated with more than one group. The job of initializer is to crate proper database tables.
 
`WallStreetDbInitializer` contains a *javadoc* that specifies database requirements. **It already contains all required Java 
implementation.** Your job is to  **implement SQL file** `table_initialization.sql`.

The purpose of the task is to **design a database table following docs and naming convention and implement it using SQL**

To verify your implementation, run `WallStreetDbInitializerTest.java`

### Pre-conditions ❗
You're supposed to be familiar with database design and naming convention, *JDBC API* and *SQL*

### How to start ❓
* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
